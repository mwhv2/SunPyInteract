# SunPyInteract
The SunPyInteract script is an experiment in combining the interactive plotting capabilities of [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) with the [SunPy](https://sunpy.org/) solar physics analysis package.
It produces interactive visualizations of SunPy Map and TimeSeries objects. To use the script, copy the SunPyInteract.py file into the same directory 
as the project file you want to use the script with. Then, import the functions you want to use.
See my [Github Page](https://mwhv2.github.io/SunPyInteract) for a short preview of SunPyInteract and the demo Jupyter Notebook for a more thorough
introduction to its capabilities. 

The SunPyInteract script is not an affiliated SunPy package.
